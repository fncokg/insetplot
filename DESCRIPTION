Description: Tools for easily and flexibly creating ggplot2 maps with inset maps. One crucial feature of maps is that they have fixed coordinate ratios, i.e., they cannot be distorted, which makes it difficult to manually place inset maps. This package provides functions to automatically position inset maps based on user-defined parameters, making it extremely easy to create maps with inset maps with minimal code.
